# Age Prediction Data Analysis

This project explores a step-by-step data analysis pipeline using Python to predict age. Age prediction is a crucial task with applications in various fields, including healthcare, marketing, and social sciences. Accurate age estimation can provide valuable insights and help make informed decisions.

# Introduction

In this project, I will use Python and several popular libraries to build a data analysis pipeline for age prediction. We will walk through the following steps:

* Data Loading and Manipulation: I will leverage the pandas library to load and manipulate the dataset. This step involves reading the data, handling missing values, and performing necessary preprocessing.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I will explore the dataset to gain insights and understand its characteristics. I will use visualization libraries such as matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful plots and charts to visualize the data.

* Outlier Detection and Handling: I will identify and handle any outliers in the dataset. Outliers can significantly impact the accuracy of our age prediction models, and it is crucial to address them appropriately.

* Data Transformation: I will explore various techniques to transform and prepare the data for modeling. This may include feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, or applying mathematical transformations to the data.

* Correlation Analysis: I will investigate the relationships between different features in the dataset and identify any strong correlations with the target variable (age). This analysis will help us understand the factors that have the most significant influence on age prediction.

* Model Selection and Evaluation: I will explore different regression models and techniques for age prediction. To implement and evaluate these models, I will utilize popular Python libraries such as PyCaret, TPOT, LightGBM, CatBoost, Optuna, and RandomizedSearchCV. The performance of each model will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics.
